You have a computer that is running an algorithm.
This is exposed through an API, that users can
request and get the responses. The traffic increases
and more people start using thsi algorithm. More
requests start coming and your M1 is unable to
handle all the requests. This is where scalability
comes in. You can do these to scale your system -

1. Vertical Scaling (VS)
	Buy an M4 (bigger and better computer than existing)

2. Horizontal Scaling (HS)
	Buy 4 M1s (more computers, but similar to existing)

Differences in HS and VS
1. HS needs load balancing, since multiple servers are
	there. VS needs no load balancing.
2. In HS, if one machine fails, traffic can be routed
	to other machines. HS systems are resilient. In
	VS, if the machine fails, everything goes down.
	It is a single point of failure.
3. In HS, communication between servers is over network.
	So it is slow. In VS, it would be inter process
	communication. So it is fast.
4. In HS, data consistency is hard to maintain because
	of all the different servers. In VS, it is easy
	because everything is in a single system.
5. In VS, hardware limits may exist. You may not get a
	system that has very high RAM or CPU and so on.
	In HS, this limit does not apply because we always
	can introduce new systems to be HS.
