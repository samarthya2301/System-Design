TCP & UDP
---------

TCP -
* Transmission Control Protocol
* Used to deliver static websited
* Wikipedia, google, email services, file download
* Large data converted into small packets
* Small packets sent over network
* With each packet a confirmation
* Eg: File download, if stops, resumes from where it
	stopped if on same network. If network switched,
	only then the connection breaks.
* Slow because it confirms if next packet to be sent or not

UDP -
* User Datagram Protocol
* Live videos and online games
* No confirmation if data received successfully or not
* Main motive is to send information
* Eg: When network goes away in live video on youtube,
	the video just stops. When reconnected, only then
	it resumes. The lost data is forever lost.


What happens when you type google.com?
--------------------------------------
1. Browser fetches url
2. Browser checks cache for the domain, if present returns IP.
3. Browser asks OS to locate the domain.
4. OS checks the host file for the domain, if present returns IP.
5. OS makes a DNS request to get IP of the domain.
6. Resolver/Internet Service Provider is queried, if present returns IP.
7. Root server is queried.
8. Root server asks the Top Level Domain Server (.COM TLD, .NET TLD, etc).
9. If TLD has it, IP is returned.
10. Authoritative Name Server is queried, which returns the IP.
11. OS now has IP. So it gives to browser. Browser makes a GET call.
12. OS sends the call that the browser gave to it, to the requested IP.
13. OS packs the request in TCP and sends to the IP.
14. Packet is sent through firewalls of both OS and Server.
15. Load balancer receives the request and sends to a server.
16. Response with IP and SSL certificate initiates HTTPS
17. HTML, CSS, JS files are returned to OS and then to browser.
18. Browser interprets these and displays.
